Your response goes here!

1. I have learned the basic HTML template, nested structure and a few basic but most commonly used tags such as "<p>,<em>,<strong>" etc. 
2. All materials and excercises by so far are easy to me since they are well structured and presentated.
3. Nothing by so far is difficult
4. Once something goes wrong or is not shown as intented, I'd like to at least check the code for twice before I turn to google or stackflow for why.
